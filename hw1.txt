Simulating a system from scratch:
Overall flow of the system page 7

-Events in M/M/1:
	- Job arrival
	- Service completion
	- Page 5 to see the flow of what happens to a event

-Data structure
	- Job
		- Arrival time
		- Execution time
	- Server 
		- Busy/idle state variabel
		- # of jobs served
	- Queue
		- List of waiting jobs (FIFO)
	Mention more data structure, unsure if this is needed?

-Generic functions
	-scheduleEvent(event, time)
	-event=getEvent();
	-inter-arrival times following exponential distribution
	-job execution times following exponential distribution
	(Code for numberGen is in the slides)

-System-specific functions
	-Define events
	-Define the operation steps for each event
	-Determine the most appropriate data stucture

-Result from Simulation
	-Each costumers arrival time and departure time
	-Avarage of the above(all the jobs)
	-Average numbers of costumers in the system as increasing the traffic intensity
	-Average queue length

-Create a simulation table for printing the graphs

Plan for the homework
- Read slide about the basics again
- Read up on MM1 queue
- Read the already implemented MM1
- First create a program with events which can simulate the system
- Create analysis tools and datastructures to support these
- Create graphs in GNU thing
- Then create graphs from queuing analysis
